## Moodle Tiny editor Cloze question type button

A plugin for the Moodle Tiny editor to callow easier creation of Cloze questions
see https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/Embedded_Answers_(Cloze)_question_type. Inspired by the Atto Cloze editor. https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/Atto_editor.

This requires Moodle 4.1 or later as that shipped with a new version of the tiny editor and the Atto editor is due to be phased out in a future version of Moodle
